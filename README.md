# SMS Text Classification Interface

This project implements a simple SMS spam detection system using machine learning and provides a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio.

## Description

The application uses a Linear Support Vector Classification model with TF-IDF vectorization to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam ("ham"). The interface allows users to input any text message and receive an immediate classification result.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - gradio

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine
2. Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio jupyter
```

## Dataset

The application uses the SMSSpamCollection dataset. Ensure the dataset file is placed in the following location:
- `Resources/SMSSpamCollection.csv`

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open `gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb`
4. Run all cells in the notebook sequentially (Cell â†’ Run All)
5. The Gradio interface will launch automatically in the notebook
6. You can now enter text messages to test if they are classified as spam or not

## Usage

1. Once the interface is running, you will see a text input box
2. Enter any SMS message you want to classify
3. The system will immediately respond with whether the message is classified as spam or not

## Example Messages to Test

Try these example messages to test the system:
- "You are a lucky winner of $5000!"
- "You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl."
- "You won 2 free tickets to the Super Bowl text us to claim your prize."
- "Thanks for registering. Text 4343 to receive free updates on medicare."

## Model Details

The classification system uses:
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization
- Linear Support Vector Classification
- 67/33 train-test split ratio
